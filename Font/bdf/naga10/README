naga10
======

a cute japanese bitmap font found on the internet; all credits to respective authors (see README_JP)

comes with diffs for maru10.bdf and min10.bdf, so if you have those you can throw them in too - they're not free though

fontconfig won't recognize this font, so you'll have to check if it's installed via xlsfonts

run ./alias.sh as superuser to put the aliases in fonts.alias into /usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.alias

requires: bdftopcf

now on the AUR - bdf-naga10-git
